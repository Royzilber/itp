# Band assignent

[GWR Band](https://github.com/Royzilber/itp/tree/main/Final_Project)

we chose to built our website based on the sample website thats in the github. 
we changed the background color slightly in the CSS file and and chose the font we wanted. 
we uploaded our image to the folder and faced our first problem. it was too big, so we wanted to scale it with the html and found out that it was esier to do in preview. 
we did it and we wanted it centerd so we copy paste the center code to the css file. 
we faced another problem with the fonts, we had in mind a spesific font but we couldnt make it work, so we chose a font from the default options. 
Will was incharge of writing our Bios. 
we wanted to explain about the image and we chose to it with blockquote and we had some hard time trying to place it in the HTML code so it makes since but after a few tries we suscceded.
everyone helped and felt like a nice funny exprience. 

# personal contribution 
i feel like i was the guy with the computer so everything went through me and orgnized everyones ideas, and if someone had an idea that wasnt in the  code i looked it up, i pushed the website to the GitHub with my domain and basically was orgnizing all the files and code. 

# team work 
i think everyone worked well on this, we all had a job, will was incharge of the artistic side, making the music and Bios, Gavin was incharge of coming up with design ideas, about fonts sizes and new things to add to the already existing code, and was the middleman testing everything orgnizing and writing the code.
