# What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Guess the word game

# In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "My project a web-based synthesizer.")

My project will be a platform for a game we play with friends which we usualy write a lot of words on paper and split to 2 teams and in turns one member of each goes and pick a random word and tries to make his team understand the word using only pantomime, i want to build a software that can save the use of paper and instead use a software to generate random words for the players to pantomime.

# In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

its going to be a HTML website using java script and css, there will be a timer for each player of 1 minute, every time he starts the timer goes off, you can press generate a word and it will generate a word from an array, you can also skip a word, when the count of the words end the game will present "game over"
